babl/GEGL

slide 0:
  babl and GEGL the core libraries providing high bitdepth pixel buffers
conversions and processsing operations for GIMP.

slide 1:

The biggest development is what the GIMP developers call the space invasion.

First babl got internal support for managing arbitrary RGB color spaces without
changing behavior of existing code in GEGL/GIMP, by having a new data-member
associated with pixel formats, the space - when NULL treat as sRGB family of
spaces.

Then GEGL got support for handling the additional space, added in all its
operations - again without changing the behavior of existing code.

This part of the space invasion is now also almost complete in GIMP.

in babl and GEGL it has continued and preliminary full support for CMYK is
in place.

slide 2:

GEGL is getting a UI again - to help with testing, development, experimenting
and verification of CMYK, non-destructive editing and other capabilities that
have not made it into GIMP yet.
