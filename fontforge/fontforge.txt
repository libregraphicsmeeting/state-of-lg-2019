Slide 1.

FontForge is a full-featured environment for designing, generating, adjusting, converting, and verifying typefaces, with support for over a dozen formats.

Slide 2.

FontForge now has an optional GDK front-end, which allows it to run without X11 on Windows and Macintosh. FontForge now exports true UFO 2 and 3 rather than the extended UFO 2 previously mandated by limitations in the ecosystem. Other recent additions include WOFF2 support, Unicode 12 support, and more granular access to splines from the scripting interface.
