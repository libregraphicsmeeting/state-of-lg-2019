  - sK1 2.0 is professional quality crossplatform illustration program. sK1 2.0 supports professional publishing features, such as multiple page document, CMYK and SPOT colors, ICC color management, professional precise printing and press-ready PDF output.
  - UniConvertor is a command line tool/library. It uses SK2 document object model to convert one file format to another.

  Unlike previous releases UniConvertor became a core part of sK1. It does all the backend jobs. Now UniConvertor joins vector and raster graphis processing and translation. Also it manages color info and color palettes.

  All import/export filters have been redesinged and rewritten from scratch to improve translation quality and provide reliable development/support workflow.

  We specifically focused on CorelDraw compatibility as for regular CDR files and for CorelDraw clipart file formats (CMX, CCX, CDRX) and different versions of CorelDraw palettes (CPL and XML). **Now the most unique feature of UniConvertor is an export to CDR and CMX file formats.**
