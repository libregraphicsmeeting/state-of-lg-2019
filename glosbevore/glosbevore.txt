A glosbevore (lat.) is an eater of glass.
It's also an animated short film that currently is in post production.
It's a nature program, or perhaps a horror film set in bright colours and to acoustic soundtrack.

The whole production chain involved open source tools like OpenToonz, Blender, Ardour, Krita, Gimp, FFMpeg, Joplin and Syncthing among others.

The film will be released with a Creative Commons licence. Source material will also be released with a cc-by license. No ETA there yet though.

The animation is done by hand with a DSLR camera.

The image sequences are put together as scenes in OpenToonz where a lot of retiming takes place. Motion is squashed and stretched until it looks believable.

Blender and Ardour is also heavily used. Blender for compositing and editing and Ardour for the soundtrack.


A bit unorganized at the moment but mail me or goto rylanderanimation.se for info and news.
