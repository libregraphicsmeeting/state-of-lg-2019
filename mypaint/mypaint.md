Slide 0

* MyPaint has been focusing on emulating paint media.
* Putting the "paint" into MyPaint

Slide 1

* Using an absorbance model (weighted geometric mean) has been fairly successful
* Blue and Yellow make green!
* And for some reason, Blue and white doesn't turn violet!
* Overall "response" and "feel" is pretty satisfying.
* But not without challenges.
* Compatibility issues with premultiplied color have yet to be solved.
* Performance issues abound; many calls to pow()
* But it looks nice.

Slide 2

* Bump Mapping with Oren Nayer to bring out the canvas texture
* Challenging to generate bump maps from tiled data without seams
* Needs more neighbor tiles!
* Lots of side-projects for color-related issues, implementing color appearance models, Pigment mixing, "truely limited palette", 
* Color Temperature Shifting, etc
* Need help with project maintenance!
* Thank you!
