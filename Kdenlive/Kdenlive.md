Kdenlive is KDE's video editing application based on the MLT framework and Qt.

In April the Kdenlive team released the 19.04 refactored code edition concluding a 3 year cycle in which more than 60% of the code base was changed with +144,000 lines of code added and +74,000 lines of code removed. This is their biggest release ever bringing new features, improved stability, greater speed and last but not least maintainability (making it easier to fix bugs and add new features).

Among the highlights of the release are:

+ Split audio/video paradigm
+ Configurable track layouts
+ Improved Kayboard navigation
+ Improved keyframe handling
+ Audio recording
+ Configurable thumbnails for each track
+ Improved proxy management
+ Speed effect 

There is still work to be done though! The team concentrated on stability (finding and fixing as many crashes as possible) and that the most important functionalities for a slim editing workflow work. There are still known issues in which they will dedicate the next 3 monthly releases of the 19.04 cycle to finish polishing the rough edges. During the first .1 release more than 40 issues were fixed.

### Coming soon

For the rest of the year the team have on the roadmap the following features:

* Nested timelines
* Same-track transitions
* OpenTimelineIO
* Advanced trimming tools

The Titler will be getting a rewrite as part of a GSOC project, which means that text animations will be back.

Also work has started to improve OpenGL support to eventually add GPU accelerated effects and rendering as well as a major speed bump.
