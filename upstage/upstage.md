UpStage

Slide 1

UpStage is a web-based platform for cyberformance - live online digital performance.

Artists located around the world collaborate in real time to create performances for online audiences, who only need a standard browser and internet to join the performance.


Slide 2

Last year we started a complete rebuild of the software, to bring the project up to date with current technologies and enable new features and enhancements. The rebuild is called Limelight.

The community of UpStage artists is eagerly looking forward to the new platform, as there is nothing else similar available. Performances are still happening in the old UpStage v3 platform, such as this one pictured - "Letters to the Earth", on 12 April 2019. 

Slide 3

Any interested people are welcome to get involved in the rebuild - we can use help with programming, architecture, interface design, testing, documentation - pretty much everything really! 

We are also interested in any related projects that could provide specific features as optional modules or that we can collaborate with in some way. 

Development is still in the early stages, we don't yet have a "1.0" release, so there is plenty of opportunity for your ideas and input.
